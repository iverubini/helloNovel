Novel prototype to participate in NaNoGenMo 2021. 

For this novel, I will optimiza this *.pde file into a p5js code, and maybe get it to work with a simple machine learning system like m5js. 

The initial code basically makes random sentences from words that were put into different categories (noun, verb, article and adjective). Each category is a string. 

I would like to make this code compatible with the detection of bodily functions - it could be the sound of breathing, or speaking, or.. well, any bodily sound! 
Maybe it would be fun to train a mahcine learning system with different bodily sounds.

Instagram became the new facebook, not only economically, but also in a linguistic realm. Instagram was first thought as a social network for people to share pictures taken in the present moment. Now everyone had the time to write inspirational life messages and post them as instagram images, and a few of us got a lot of visibility while doing so. But is instagram fit for the delivering?

I found it very amusing that a simple western formula for the production of knowledge turned out so coherent when it comes to inspirational instagram posts: affirmation, questioning, resolution. Three simple sentences. 

A first glimpse on my interpretation of that can be seen at https://editor.p5js.org/iverubini/sketches/seAX5ibyX . Now I'd like to turn it into a novel with 50k words, and i think the solution is to generate thousands of instagram posts using Processing.

For the final version, I calculated the average of words in each page, which was 82. So I multiplied this by 610, in order to achieve 50k words in total, resulting in 610 pages consisting in 6 inspirational instagram posts. 

The final structure of each post was: affirmation + icon + question + longer affirmation + hashtag. 

For a greater variety of sentences, I used two word banks: https://github.com/janester/mad_libs/blob/master/List%20of%20Plural%20Nouns.txt for nouns and https://www.wordexample.com/list/verbs-in-english#google_vignette for verbs conjugated in the third person. 

I used this dingbat font for the icons: https://www.dafont.com/de/cute-icons.font . I didn't use all of the characters like letters v, r and x. 

People's names came from sci-fi stories like 1984, Brave New World and Rocky Horror Picture Show. 

The file affirmations.pde generates one frame per play in Processing, and affirmations_pdf.pde generates 610 pages with 6 instagram posts each.
