# helloNovel
Novel prototype to participate in NaNoGenMo 2021. 


For this novel, I will optimiza this *.pde file into a p5js code, and maybe get it to work with a simple machine learning system like m5js. 

The initial code basically makes random sentences from words that were put into different categories (noun, verb, article and adjective). Each category is a string. 

I would like to make this code compatible with the detection of bodily functions - it could be the sound of breathing, or speaking, or.. well, any bodily sound! 
Maybe it would be fun to train a mahcine learning system with different bodily sounds.
